## What is Tushan Lite

Tushan Lite is a purely configuration-based solution built on Tushan, requiring only a simple configuration file to implement a complete set of front-end solutions for backend management projects.

## Quick Experience

You can visit [https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/?config=https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/demo.json](https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/?config=https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/demo.json) to view the sample project.

Viewing [https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/demo.json](https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/demo.json) allows you to see the demo configuration.

### Using Custom Configurations

You can append your own configuration file after `?config=`, like: `https://tushan-lite.msgbyte.com/?config=<config-url>`

## Will Tushan Lite Steal or Intercept User Information?

No, Tushan Lite is just a front-end running container. If you understand `react native`/`Swagger`, you can comprehend that the position of `Tushan Lite` is similar to `Expo`/`Swagger`. The specific backend implementation still needs to be sent to your own remote server.

If still concerned, you can compile/deploy it to your own server. The source code is here: [https://github.com/msgbyte/tushan/tree/master/lite](https://github.com/msgbyte/tushan/tree/master/lite)
