# Icons

Since `Tushan` integrates `arco-design`, and `arco-design` comes with a set of icons by default, `Tushan` can directly use the icon designs from `arco-design`.

The complete list of icons can be accessed at: [https://arco.design/react/components/icon](https://arco.design/react/components/icon)

## Usage

To use icons separately, you need to import them via `tushan/icon`.

```tsx
import { IconUser } from "tushan/icon"

<IconUser />
```
