# Why Choose Tushan

## Motivation

In software development, the development of backend applications is a crucial aspect. However, many developers despise developing backend applications. This is because many backend applications involve repetitive CRUD operations along with some minor special logic. The work on these repetitive templates is not worth spending time on.

At the same time, we can see that most UI systems involve a significant amount of repetitive work (such as buttons, forms, layouts, displays, etc.). Similarly, most backend management platforms also involve a lot of repetitive work. If we can abstract UI requirements into reusable design components, why can't we abstract our backend requirements into a ready-to-use library?

## What Makes Tushan Special

There are many ready-made, complete `xx-admin` applications available in the market, which provide you with a complete `admin` project out of the box. They offer you a full stack of technologies, and you only need to run a command to start, and then make modifications and adjustments according to your needs.

But are these really efficient? Facing a complete and complex system all at once, many people find themselves at a loss and have to spend a lot of time learning documentation and reading source code. Many beginners or those who encounter such systems for the first time tend to attribute the difficulty to themselves, thinking it's a matter of their own capabilities. However, from my years of programming experience, I can say that this is not necessarily the fault of the developers themselves.

#### Subtraction Is Always Harder Than Addition

Most systems available in the market are pre-built applications that require you to subtract from them. Later, when your requirements exceed the predefined framework, you naturally accumulate a significant amount of technical debt. Technical debt often arises because the design purposes of the same system in the early and later stages are different, and ready-made systems cannot fully meet the requirements for secondary development. Therefore, this is why many developers are unwilling to engage in secondary development of a complete system.

With increasing investment, you often face the need for refactoring. Ultimately, you may have to start over, which represents the limit of such ready-made systems.

The design of `tushan`, on the other hand, aims to break the dilemma of the difficulty in getting started, development difficulty, high learning costs, and low ceiling of traditional `xx-admin` systems.

Compared to a ready-made system, `tushan` positions itself more as a **toolbox**. You can quickly build a ready-to-use frontend project for backend management by using the provided tools. The advantage of being a toolbox is that you can seamlessly integrate `tushan` into existing frontend projects. Furthermore, the learning curve of `tushan` is a very smooth curve rather than a steep one. The progressive development experience is very comfortable.

Compared to the difficulty of subtraction, `tushan` guides developers to do addition. In the process of addition, many repetitive tasks are completed by `Tushan`, allowing business developers to focus on their own business.

## Advantages of Tushan

#### Changes in Completion with Time Investment

In `tushan`, you can confidently invest time and experience linear changes, instead of quickly obtaining a complete project and then facing difficulties.

#### Long-Term Accompaniment is Better Than a One-Time Deal

The positioning of `Tushan` itself is a library, not a ready-made system. `Tushan` can provide developers with a quick start page and accompany users in development for the long term.

If one can understand the definition of a component library in the development life cycle process, then one can also understand what `Tushan` does and its positioning.

#### Flexibility

When using some ready-made libraries, you often face a problem: can the work done by others match your needs well? What if it doesn't match?

However, each component of `Tushan` is freely definable. If you don't have high interface requirements, you can quickly build a fully functional page with `Tushan`. If you have high customization requirements, you can only use some of `Tushan`'s functions while customizing others.
